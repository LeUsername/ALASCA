<p><b>Molene example of a DEVS simulation architecture.</b></p>

<p>
This package proposes an example of a DEVS simulation architecture built around
the concepts of the Molene system designed by Maria-Teresa Segarra in her thesis
(IRISA/U. Rennes I).

<p>
Molene is a system that aims at optimising the data flow between a PC running on
battery and a server that are connected through a WiFi network. The idea is to
use data compression to lower the bandwidth requirements and get a better data
transfer rate when the WiFi bandwidth is low. However, as the PC runs on
battery, compressing and uncompressing requires more processing and therefore
drains the battery faster. Hence, to save battery life, compression must only
be used when the bandwidth is low.
