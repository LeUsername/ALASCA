<p><b>Architectures of DEVS simulation models.</b></p>

<p>
This package implements architectures of DEVS simulation models. In this
library, architectures are descriptions of models that must be instantiated
and connected in order to form a composed model ready to be run. The package
<code>fr.sorbonne_u.devs_simulation.architectures</code> defines the overall
architectures. This package defines the descriptions of atomic and coupled
models that are included into overall architectures.
