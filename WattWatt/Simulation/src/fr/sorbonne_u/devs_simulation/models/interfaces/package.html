<p><b>Interfaces for DEVS simulation models.</b></p>

<p>
This package provides two sets of interfaces defining operations used at
different time with DEVS models. A first set defines the operations used on
atomic and coupled models at simulation execution time. The second set are
interfaces for model factories used at simulation architecture description
and instantiation time as facilities to create instances of atomic
and coupled models in the composition process leading to a run time
simulation architecture.
