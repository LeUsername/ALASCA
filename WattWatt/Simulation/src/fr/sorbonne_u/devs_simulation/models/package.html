<p><b>DEVS models</b></p>

<p>
This package defines the interfaces and abstract classes implementing the
core behaviour of DEVS models. It also defines the factories used in simulation
architecture descriptions to instantiate models when required. Models that
obey the standard instantiation protocols (constructors with the same
parameters) defined by the classes in this package do not need to use
factories. The composition process can use model classes directly for
instantiation rather than factories in this case.
