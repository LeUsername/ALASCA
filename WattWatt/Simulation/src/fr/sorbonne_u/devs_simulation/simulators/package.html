<p><b>DEVS simulation engines.</b></p>

<p>
This packages defines the implementation of simulation engines.
DEVS simulation engines implements simulation algorithms at their
level. Essentially, they ensure the coordinated execution of
models by implementing a strategy to coordinate their simulation
clocks in such a way that they respect the advance of the global
simulation clock.
</p>

<p>
Strategies to coordinate the simulation clocks can go from perfect
synchronisation to no synchronisation at all. The standard DEVS
coordination algorithm is an example of perfect synchronisation
as the coordinators select the most imminent internal step to be
performed among all of their atomic models and then perform each of
them one at a time making sure that the simulation clocks of all
models advance at exactly the same global pace. Such globally
synchronised algorithms ensure a deterministic execution of simulation
runs but are ill-suited for parallel or distributed simulations as
they force a fully serialised execution of all events. The classes
<code>SimulationEngine</code>, <code>AtomicEngine</code>
and <code>CoordinationEngine</code> implement the standard DEVS
coordination algorithm with tightly synchronised simulation clocks.
</p>

<p>
Other algorithms, like the real time one, align the simulation clocks
to the real time (e.g., using the computer clock).
These unsynchronised algorithms are fine when the models are loosely
coupled and when the simulation results can admit some imprecision
if the models remain sufficiently synchronised implicitly, like
models carrying out continuous simulations over differential equations
with integration steps among models that are small and close to each
others so that the imprecision amounts to relatively small differences
in the tiles at which the variables have been last updated.
