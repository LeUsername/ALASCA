<p><b>Events for event scheduling DEVS simulation models</b></p>

<p>
This package implements generic events for DEVS simulation models adopting
the event scheduling world view. Compared to standard events, these events
provide methods to create events that are generated from their execution
and to execute the event on atomic event scheduling models to change their
state.
