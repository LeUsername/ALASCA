<p><b>HIOA DEVS simulation models</b></p>

<p>
This package defines the interfaces and abstract classes implementing the
core behaviour of HIOA DEVS models. It also defines the factories used in
simulation architecture descriptions to instantiate models when required.
HIOA models that obey the standard instantiation protocols (constructors
with the same parameters) defined by the classes in this package do not
need to use factories. The composition process can use model classes
directly for instantiation rather than factories in this case.
